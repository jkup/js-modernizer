# JavaScript Modernizer

This project is an educational tool designed to help you learn more about compilers and how they work. The goal of this project is to create a simplified version of tools like Babel, Acorn and ESTree.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main folders:

1. **jacorn**: This folder contains the code for our custom JavaScript parser, which is a replacement for the Acorn parser. The parser reads JavaScript code, tokenizes it, and generates an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

2. **jabel**: This folder contains the code for our custom JavaScript transpiler, which is a replacement for Babel. The transpiler reads the AST generated by our parser, applies transformations to modernize the code, and generates the modernized JavaScript code.
